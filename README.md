Hi, I’m Boshen.

Creator of [Oxc](https://oxc.rs), [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) and [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter.html).

VP Engineering at [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev), helping make [Vite](http://vite.dev) faster through [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs).

I build high-performance JavaScript and Rust tooling and contribute across the ecosystem to make open source faster, safer, and better for everyone.

### 🚀 What I work on

* [Oxc](https://oxc.rs): Fastest JavaScript and TypeScript parser, linter, formatter and resolver
* [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) - Fast Rust-based bundler for JavaScript
* Performance + correctness improvements across the JavaScript ecosystem
* [cargo-shear](https://github.com/Boshen/cargo-shear) - Remove unused dependencies from Cargo.toml

### 💚 Why sponsor?

Sponsorship helps me keep improving the JavaScript and Rust ecosystems while preventing burnout from maintaining fast and evolving tools in my personal time.

If my work has improved your development experience, your CI pipelines, your build times, or your learning in any way, please consider sponsoring. It helps more than you might think, and it truly keeps the motivation alive.

### ⭐ Sponsor Visibility
