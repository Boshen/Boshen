Hello! My name is Boshen and I am currently developing [Oxc](https://github.com/Boshen/oxc), a collection of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oxc is a MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use.

Your [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/Boshen) will help the sustainability of the project.

I also maintain these helpful tools:

* [cargo-shear](https://github.com/Boshen/cargo-shear): Detect and remove unused dependencies from Cargo.toml in Rust projects.
* [criterion2.rs](https://github.com/Boshen/criterion2.rs): Keep criterion updated with renovate bot.
* [json-strip-comments](https://github.com/oxc-project/json-strip-comments): Strip JSON comments and trailing commas in place.
* [unicode-id-start](https://github.com/oxc-project/unicode-id-start): Implementation of Unicode Standard Annex #31 (ID_Start and ID_Continue) for determining which char values are valid in programming language (mainly JavaScript) identifiers.
